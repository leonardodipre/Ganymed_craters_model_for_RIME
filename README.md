# Ganymed_craters_model_for_RIME
Design a comprehensive model delineating various crater types found on Ganymede's surface. This model is intended for integration with RIME (Radar for Icy Moon Exploration) during the JUICE (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) mission. Its purpose is to analyze the collected radargrams and gain insights into the formation processes and diverse categories of craters present on the icy moon's surface.
